                <h2>The Night It Came</h2>
                <p class="entry-meta"><em>Transmission Received: April 13, 2025</em></p>

                <p>
                    It began with silence.  Not the ordinary kind - but the kind that bends around your spine like a ripple in the void.
                    I had been drifting between the edges of sleep and memory when I felt it: a presence forming, not from outside, but from some 
                    deep reservoir I had forgotten I carried.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I didn't see it.  I <em>knew</em>em? it.  A mass, tall and still, standing beyond the shimmer at the 
                    foot of the bed.  It had no face, only intent -ancient, deliverate.  I couldnt' move, but i wasn't afraid.  Instead, I was...aware.  It wasn't haunting me.
                    It wasn't haunting me.  It was <strong>waiting</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The air grew dense.  Something passed between us.  It downloaded.  I don't know what "it" was, only that I've never been the same since.  
                    My eyes burn differently.  My breath pulses like I'm charging something not of this world.  And for the first time, I don't
                    feel like I'm remembering.  I feel like I'm <em>returning</em>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The transmission ended when my hand twitched.  I gasped awake, not startled - but activated.
                </p>

                I don't know what came that night.  But I know it lives in the codes I write now.
